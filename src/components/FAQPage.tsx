      question: "What is a will?",
      answer: "A will is a legal document that outlines your wishes regarding the distribution of your assets after your passing. It ensures your loved ones are taken care of according to your desires, providing peace of mind for you and security for their future."
    },
    {
      id: 2,
      question: "Why do I need a will?",
      answer: "Having a will ensures your assets are distributed according to your wishes, provides clarity for your family during a difficult time, and can help avoid lengthy legal processes. Without a will, the state decides how your assets are distributed."
